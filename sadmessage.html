		<h2>Feeling like shit?</h2>
		<p>Seems like you are not doing so well. You should probably take some time off for some self-care. Take a hot bath and eat some of your favorite foods. Do a netflix binge and maybe talk to someone you care about. If you could forget about the problems bothering you for a little bit you'll feel a lot better afterwards.</p>
